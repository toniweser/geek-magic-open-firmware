- Four scenes switch with the part of the day at your location: sunrise, day, dusk and night. Dawn, sunrise, sunset and dusk are computed on the device, no server involved.
- Animations use PXA, a small run-length encoded format with a palette and raw frames. The ESP8266 has about 25 KB of free RAM, far too little for a GIF decoder, so this player needs about 6 KB instead.
- Make your own animations with `tools/pxa.py`: it renders the bundled scenes, converts small GIFs and renders a `.pxa` back to GIF for checking.
- Everything is configured in `config.json`: API token, location, timezone, which file plays in which phase. Switch scenes or files at runtime through `POST /api/v1/screen`.
- Flashing works over WiFi from the stock firmware, no cables. Step by step in [FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md), including rescue mode if something goes wrong.
- Based on [Times-Z/GeekMagic-Open-Firmware](https://github.com/Times-Z/GeekMagic-Open-Firmware), which provides WiFi setup, OTA updates, the web UI and the rescue mode. Its original documentation follows below.

## Screen hardware configuration

### Display specifications

- **Controller**: ST7789
- **Resolution**: 240x240 pixels
- **Color Format**: RGB565 (16-bit color)
- **Interface**: SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- **SPI Speed**: 40 MHz (80 MHz is possible, but unstable and outside datasheet spec)
- **Rotation**: Upside-down for cube display, normal for the small tv

### Pin wiring

The wiring is the same form small TV and cube

The display is connected to the ESP8266 using the following GPIO pins:

| Function      | GPIO Pin | Description                                           |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **MOSI**      | GPIO 13  | SPI Master Out Slave In (data from ESP8266 to screen) |
| **SCK**       | GPIO 14  | SPI Clock                                             |
| **CS**        | GND      | Chip Select, tied permanently to GND                  |
| **DC**        | GPIO 0   | Data/Command select (LOW=command, HIGH=data)          |
| **RST**       | GPIO 2   | Reset pin                                             |
| **Backlight** | GPIO 5   | Backlight control (Active LOW)                        |

### ESP8266 dev board wiring example

For a common ESP8266 dev board such as a NodeMCU or ESP-12E development board, wire the TFT module like this:

| TFT pin        | ESP8266 GPIO | Common dev board label | Notes                                      |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **GND**        | GND          | GND                    | Ground                                     |
| **VCC**        | 3V3          | 3V3                    | Power the display from 3.3V                |
| **SCL / SCK**  | GPIO 14      | D5                     | SPI clock                                  |
| **SDA / MOSI** | GPIO 13      | D7                     | SPI data from ESP8266 to display           |
| **DC**         | GPIO 0       | D3                     | Data/command select                        |
| **RES / RST**  | GPIO 2       | D4                     | Display reset                              |
| **BLK**        | GPIO 5       | D1                     | Optional backlight control, see note below |

If your module has no **CS** pin, or if **CS** is already tied low on the PCB, no extra wiring is needed for chip select.

Many 1.3" ST7789 modules keep the backlight enabled when **BLK** is left floating. In that case the screen will work without connecting **BLK** at all. If you want firmware-controlled backlight, connect **BLK** to GPIO 5.

Be aware that **GPIO 0** and **GPIO 2** are ESP8266 boot strap pins. This wiring matches the original hardware used by the firmware, but if your module pulls either line to the wrong level during reset the ESP8266 may fail to boot.

### Important configuration details

**Chip select (CS) polarity**: This board ties CS of the display permanently to GND.

**SPI mode**: SPI Mode 3 (CPOL=1, CPHA=1)

**Data/command pin**: LOW for commands, HIGH for data

**Backlight**: Active-low control - set GPIO 5 LOW to turn the backlight on, HIGH to turn it off

## How the screen works

### Initialization sequence

The firmware initializes the display through the `lcdEnsureInit()` function which performs the following steps:

1. **Backlight activation**: GPIO 5 is configured as output and driven based on the `LCD_BACKLIGHT_ACTIVE_LOW` configuration (typically driven LOW to turn on the backlight)

2. **SPI bus initialization**: Hardware SPI is initialized with:
    - Clock speed: Defined by `LCD_SPI_HZ` (typically 40 MHz)
    - Mode: Defined by `LCD_SPI_MODE` (Mode 3 required for this display)

3. **Hardware reset sequence**: The RST pin (GPIO 2) is toggled with timing:
    - Set HIGH → wait 120ms → Set LOW → wait 120ms → Set HIGH → wait 120ms

4. **Display controller initialization**: A vendor-specific initialization sequence is executed via `lcdRunVendorInit()` which includes:
    - Sleep out (0x11) with 120ms delay
    - Porch settings (0xB2) with parameters: HS=0x1F, VS=0x1F, Dummy=0x00, HBP=0x33, VBP=0x33
    - Tearing effect (0x35) set to OFF (0x00)
    - Memory access control/MADCTL (0x36) set to default (0x00)
    - Color mode (0x3A) set to 16-bit RGB565 (0x05)
    - Power control settings:
        - Power B7 (0xB7) = 0x00
        - Power BB (0xBB) = 0x36
        - Power C0 (0xC0) = 0x2C
        - Power C2 (0xC2) = 0x01
        - Power C3 (0xC3) = 0x13
        - Power C4 (0xC4) = 0x20
        - Power C6 (0xC6) = 0x13
        - Power D0 (0xD0) = 0xA4, 0xA1
        - Power D6 (0xD6) = 0xA1
    - Gamma correction (0xE0, 0xE1) with predefined curves (14 bytes each)
    - Gamma control (0xE4) = 0x1D, 0x00, 0x00
    - Display inversion (0x21)
    - Display ON (0x29)
    - Column address setup (0x2A): 0x00 to 0xEF
    - Row address setup (0x2B): 0x00 to 0xEF
    - RAM write command (0x2C)

5. **Post-initialization**:
    - 10ms delay for display stabilization
    - Display rotation is applied (from configuration via `getLCDRotationSafe()`)
    - Screen is filled with black and text color is set to white

### SPI Communication Protocol

The ST7789 communicates via SPI with the following signal handling:

1. **Clock**: SCK (GPIO 14) - drives the SPI clock at the configured frequency (40 MHz)
2. **Data**: MOSI (GPIO 13) - carries command bytes or pixel data from ESP8266 to display
3. **Chip Select**: CS is permanently tied to GND (always active)
4. **Data/Command mode**: DC pin (GPIO 0) indicates the type of data:
    - DC = LOW: Command byte follows
    - DC = HIGH: Pixel/parameter data follows

The display requires **SPI Mode 3** (CPOL=1, CPHA=1) which is explicitly configured in the initialization sequence.

### Drawing to the screen

The firmware uses the **Arduino_GFX library** with a custom ST7789 display driver. Drawing operations are managed through the global `g_lcd` instance:

1. **Text rendering**:
    - Implemented via `lcdDrawTextWrapped()` which provides word-wrapping support
    - Text wrapping algorithm handles spaces, tabs, and newlines
    - Text size is scaled by integer multipliers (6×8 pixels per character at size 1)
    - Supports automatic line wrapping with configurable character and line limits

2. **Graphics primitives**:
    - Direct access to Arduino_GFX API via `DisplayManager::getGfx()`
    - Rectangle filling: `fillRect(x, y, width, height, color)`
    - Full screen fills: `fillScreen(color)`
    - Direct SPI writes are batched between `beginWrite()` and `endWrite()` calls

3. **GIF playback**:
    - Managed via the `Gif` class instance `s_gif`
    - Supports full-screen GIF playback with optional duration limits
    - Can be stopped at any time via `DisplayManager::stopGif()`

4. **Performance optimizations**:
    - **Hardware SPI**: Uses ESP8266's hardware SPI peripheral (40 MHz) for efficient transfers
    - **Batch writes**: Commands and data are batched between `beginWrite()`/`endWrite()` calls
    - **Yield calls**: `yield()` is called during long operations to prevent watchdog timeout
    - **Direct streaming**: GIF frames are streamed directly without intermediate buffering

### Color format

The display uses **RGB565** (16-bit) color encoding:

- **Red channel**: 5 bits (bits 15-11)
- **Green channel**: 6 bits (bits 10-5)
- **Blue channel**: 5 bits (bits 4-0)

This format provides 65,536 distinct colors and is the standard for ST7789 displays.

**Common color constants** (defined in DisplayManager.h):

- Black: `0x0000`
- White: `0xFFFF`
- Red: `0xF800`
- Green: `0x07E0`
- Blue: `0x001F`
- Cyan: `0x07FF`
- Magenta: `0xF81F`
- Yellow: `0xFFE0`

    etc...

## What's next ?

Okay, now we have a minimal firmware that works.

I really like ESP devices and I really enjoy working with ESP-IDF, so I’m planning ~~if possible (I haven’t checked compatibility yet, I’m still new to this world)~~ to create a firmware close to the original one in terms of features, but fully open source ofc \o/

Since ESP IDF is not compatible with esp8266, i'm going to build the firmware on top of [plateformIO](https://platformio.org/)

That’s the project, at least

## PlateformIO Firmware

This is the "real" firmware I want to improve, with clean and reliable code

## Installation Guide

To use the open-source firmware on your compatible GeekMagic device, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Times-Z/GeekMagic-Open-Firmware.git
```

### 2. Configure the JSON file

```bash
cp data/config-{hellocubic|smalltv}.example data/config.json
```

You can edit this JSON file to configure your firmware, for example by modifying `wifi_ssid` and `wifi_password` so that your device connects to your network

Note: The Wi-Fi credentials and API token in config.json are migrated to EEPROM "secure storage" on first boot. After that, these credentials are erased from config.json

**Configuration options:**

- `wifi_ssid`: Your WiFi network name
- `wifi_password`: Your WiFi password
- `api_token`: Bearer token for API authentication
- `lcd_rotation`: Display rotation setting
- `ntp_server`: NTP server for time synchronization

Security of stored secrets:

- All sensitive values (API keys, wifi credentials, tokens, etc.) are stored in EEPROM using a device-unique obfuscation scheme
- The obfuscation key is derived from the ESP8266's MAC address, chip ID, and a salt (configurable [here](./src/main.cpp#L41) in code) using SHA-256
- The JSON payload is XORed with this derived key before being written to EEPROM, and de-obfuscated on read
- This makes it much harder to recover secrets from a raw flash dump on another device, or with only partial knowledge of the hardware

Limitations:

- This is not true encryption and does not provide hardware-backed security or protection against a determined attacker with full device access
- The public salt is not secret; if an attacker knows the salt, MAC, and chip ID, they can reconstruct the key
- There is no secure element or tamper resistance

**Do not assume confidentiality against a determined attacker**

Warning: If the salt, the chip ID or the mac address change, the eeprom secure storage is clear and reset to ensure no data leak is possible

### 3. Build the firmware and filesystem

To build the firmware you can use decontainer, docker or build it by yourself using [PlateformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/methods/installer-script.html)

```bash
pio run && pio run --target buildfs

# or using devcontainer aliases

build && buildfs

# or docker

./scripts/build-with-docker.sh
```

The generated files will be located in:

```
.pio/build/esp12e/
```

### 4. Flash the firmware

There are two possible flashing methods:

- **OTA (Over-The-Air)** – no prerequisites
- **USB** – requires a USB-to-TTL converter to connect to the ESP

---

### OTA Flashing

Flashing is done in two steps

#### Step 1: Flash the firmware

Go to:

```
http://{your_geekmagic_ip}/update
```

This is the update endpoint of the original firmware. Upload the `firmware.bin` file

Once this step is complete, the device will reboot. Depending on the model, the screen orientation may be correct or not — this is normal

At this point, only the firmware has been flashed. The filesystem (configuration, web app) still needs to be flashed

#### Step 2: Flash the filesystem

The firmware will create a Wi‑Fi access point with the following credentials:

- **SSID:** `GeekMagic`
- **Password:** `$str0ngPa$$w0rd`

Connect to this access point and go to:

```
http://192.168.4.1/legacyupdate
```

From there, select and flash the filesystem using the `littlefs.bin` file

Once the device reboots, the setup is complete!

## Rescue Boot Mode

If the device fails to boot successfully several times in a row (boot loop), it will automatically enter **Rescue Mode** on the next restart. Rescue Mode provides a minimal Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) and a web API for recovery and debugging, even if the main firmware is broken.

**How Rescue Mode works:**

- The firmware tracks boot failures using the ESP8266's RTC user memory.
- If the device crashes or resets too many times before reaching a stable state, Rescue Mode is triggered.
- In Rescue Mode, the device:
    - Starts a Wi-Fi AP with the same SSID and password as normal operation.
    - Serves a debug web page and a minimal API (no authentication required).
    - Allows you to reset the API token, upload new firmware (OTA), or reboot the device.
    - Displays a debug screen with system info (heap, CPU, screen, version, etc.).

**Rescue API endpoints:**

- `GET /api/v1/rescue/status` — System/debug info (JSON)
- `POST /api/v1/rescue/token` — Reset API token (JSON body: `{ "token": "newtoken" }`)
- `POST /api/v1/rescue/reboot` — Reboot device
- `POST /api/v1/rescue/ota` — Upload new firmware (multipart/form-data)

**When to use Rescue Mode:**

- If the device is stuck in a boot loop or fails to start normally
- If you lose access to the web UI or API due to a misconfiguration
- To recover from a failed firmware update

**How to exit Rescue Mode:**

- After a successful boot and stable operation, the crash counter is reset automatically
- Reboot the device after fixing the issue (e.g., uploading new firmware or resetting the token)
